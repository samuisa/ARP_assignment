# ARP_assignment1
This project implements a simulation of a drone moving in a 2D environment.

The architecture is composed of 5 separate processes that communicate using unnamed pipes. These processes manage the overall logic, user input, the drone itself, obstacles, and targets within the 2D environment. The communication is managed by the main process, which creates the pipes and the child processes.

<br>**Architecture and Processes**

</div>

**MAIN** $\rightarrow$ This process handles initialization, creation of the pipes and the child processes, and waits for the termination of all processes.

**BLACKBOARD** $\rightarrow$ This process acts as the system's server. It uses select() to simultaneously monitor the various pipes connected to the other processes. 

- Initialization: configures the ncurses environment and sends the window dimensions to the other processes (except to the input process).
- Visualization Update: updates the display of the drone (+), obstacles (O), and targets(T) when it receives their positions from each process.  
- When the input process sends the character from the user keyboard, Blackboard process forwards it to the drone process, which updates the drone force respecting the position of obstacles and edges.

**INPUT** $\rightarrow$ This process displays a non-interactive ncurses legend detailing the keys the user can press. It captures the user's keystrokes and sends them to the blackboard process.

**DRONE** $\rightarrow$ The drone process calculates its new position based on:

- Its internal dynamics.
- Manual forces sent by the user input.
- Repulsive force generated by obstacles and environment borders.

Finally, it sends its updated position to the blackboard process.

**OBSTACLES** $\rightarrow$ This process generates a matrix of fixed obstacles based on a percentage of the window dimensions and sends this matrix to the blackboard process.

**TARGETS** $\rightarrow$ This process generates the targets in the same manner as obstacles, ensuring they do not overlap with obstacles or borders, and sends them to the blackboar process.

<br>**Additioinal Features**
<br>As additional details for this project, a **Log File** and **Parameter Files** have been implemented.
The log files are useful for tracking the drone's behavior every time the user presses a key. Specifically, they are used to follow:
- the key pressed by the user;
- the new force that is applied to the drone.
The parameter files store useful structs and system parameters necessary for the simulation processes.

**How to Run the simulation**

To compile and launch the 2D Drone Simulation project, follow these steps in your terminal:
- make
<br>Once compiled, to execute the main program and open the separate ncurses windows (Input, Window/Blackboard):
- make run
<br>The simulation should now be active, displaying the drone environment and the input legend.
